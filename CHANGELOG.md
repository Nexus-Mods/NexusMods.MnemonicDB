## Changelog

### 0.9.81 - 19/09/2024
* Fix a bug the source generators when trying to use HashedBlobAttributes

### 0.9.80 - 22/08/2024
* `IAnalyzer` gets both the new database and the old database as arguments. This allows for looking up the previous state of entities for retractions

### 0.9.79 - 19/08/2024
* Fix a bug with `Tuple<T1, T2, T3>` attributes when the first member is a reference type. This caused temporary IDs to not
be resolved correctly when the temporary ID was resolved

### 0.9.78 - 15/08/2024
* `Model.ObserveAll` now returns `IObservable<IChangeSet<ReadOnly, EntityId>>` instead of `IObservable<IChangeSet<ReadOnly, DatomKey>>` which makes it
easier to use in projects without polluting the code with `DatomKey` references. `Connection.ObserveDatoms` still returns `IObservable<IChangeSet<Datom, DatomKey>>`

### 0.9.77 - 15/08/2024
* Added extension methods to query multiple indexed datoms at once. Results from the database are merge-joined into a
single list that is extremely fast to calculate. 
* Rewrote `ObserveDatoms` resulting in a roughly 1000x speedup when 10,000 datoms are being observed. The function now returns
`IObservable<IChangeSet<Datom, DatomKey>>` which allows for extremely efficient set-like operations on the datoms being observed
